        <li>leaving your home to go out</li>
        <li>following a route you know well</li>
        <li>using public transport timetables to travel to somewhere new</li>
        <li>working out a new route and following it, for example, if you find a road is closed on a route you know well and need to plan and follow a different route</li>
