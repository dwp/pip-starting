          Tell us how your conditions or disabilities affect you

            <li>tell us all the conditions and disabilities you have</li>
            <li>add details of health and care professionals you have not already told us about</li>
            <li>describe how your conditions or disabilities affect your ability to do certain everyday tasks and get around</li>
            <li>upload any supporting evidence of your conditions or disabilities and how they affect you</li>

          <p>Take your time and give as much information as you can. You do not have to answer all the questions in one go. You can save your progress at any point and continue later.</p>
