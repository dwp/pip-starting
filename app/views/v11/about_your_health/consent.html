            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How DWP uses this information</h2>

            <p>If you agree, DWP will store your consent on your behalf. This means your health and care professionals will know they are legally allowed to share information about you.</p>
            <p>DWP needs information about your health condition and how it affects you.</p>
            <p>The law allows DWP to get, keep, and use this information for the purpose of processing and making a decision on:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

              <li>your Personal Independence Payment claim</li>
              <li>any other benefit youâ€™ve claimed</li>
              <li>any other benefit you may claim or be awarded in the future</li>
              <li>any mandatory reconsideration or appeal</li>

            </ul>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you change your mind</h2>
            <p>You can change your mind at any time. If you do, DWP will not ask your health and care professionals to share any more
                information.</p>
