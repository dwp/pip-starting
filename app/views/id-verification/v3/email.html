        <p>Dear ((full name)),</p>

        <p>Thank you for agreeing to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).</p>

        <p>This is a new service. By using it you'll help us to develop and improve it.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Make a claim</h2>

        <p>You'll need to register and create a password before you start your claim. This will let you securely save progress and retirn later if you need to take any breaks.</p>

        <p>You can use any device connected to the internet to claim.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          Register and claim at <a href="/id-verification/v3/intro-question">https://www.apply-for-pip.gov.uk</a>
        </div>

        <p>Save this web address in your internet browser or keep this email safe. Youâ€™ll need it to get back to your claim if you do not complete it in one go.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to submit your claim by</h2>

        <p>Register and complete the first stage of the claim as soon as you can. This usually takes around 15 minutes. The date you complete this first stage will be your date of claim. The sooner you do this, the earlier your payments could begin if you're awarded PIP.</p>

        <p>You'll see a message on-screen to confirm when you've done this. It will also tell you the date you need to complete the rest of your claim by.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get help</h2>

        <p>If you need help, you can also a friend, relative, carer, representative, or local support organisation to help you.</p>
