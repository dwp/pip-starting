      <p>Before we can make a decision about your claim we need to check your identity. We check everyone's identity to protect from fraud.</p>

      <p>You'll need to register with our identity checking system and create a password so you can sign in - this is separate from your Apply for PIP password.</p>

      <p>If you have already registered to confirm your identity for PIP, sign in with the password you have created.</p>
